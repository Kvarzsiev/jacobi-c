# jacobi-c
An implementation of the Jacobi iterative method in C

  This piece of code is a project done for college, on the Fundamentals of Operating Systems (Processes and Threads were the main points here)

  ## What is in the Project?
  There are two versions of the "Jacobi iterative algorithm for determining the solutions of a strictly diagonally dominant system", being one done with 
  processes and shared memory, and the other with threads. Both are synchronized by a Two-Phase Barrier or Reusable Barrier implementation, as stated in
  *"The Little Book of Semaphores"* - **Chapter 3.7.5 - Reusable Barrier Solution** 
  
  I decided to let some faulty versions of code that I've wrote before the final working version inside the **codefaults** folder.
